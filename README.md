## Milestone 1 Feedback
Awesome job on your Milestone 1! Your persona is super realistic and well fleshed out and it matches with your stated goals. You have enough detail here to really let it guide your next phases of PWP. Nice job!

Your HTML overall looks great - you don't need extra spaces between lines since your indentation makes it very readable, and be sure to match up where you're opening and closing ul and li tags such as on line 51 to avoid confusion. You also have a stray li tag at the bottom of the page that I'm not sure what it's for - just something to keep in mind. And finally, you can create an images folder for all those PNGs to keep your directory structure clean.

Be sure to watch your .gitignore: You want to have just a slash and no dot in front of vendor, because it's a directory (hence the slash) and it's not hidden (a dot means it's hidden from normal file lists).

Overall your work looks great and you got it in early, so this comes in at a Tier IV. Great job!!

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Your Milestone 2a looks great! Your content strategy is really clear, shows off your wide range of skillsets, and your wireframes look really good and make sense going from desktop to mobile. It's also great you did some research into how you want to do some of the features you want to add. Your HTML is also great and you turned it in early, so your Milestone 2a passes easily at a Tier IV! Great job!
